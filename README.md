# TP2-IHC-Practical-Android

This is a practical activity for the discipline Interaction Human-Computer of Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. 

- The Request was to match the following criteria on this project: 
    1) Create an application that contains a textView, two editText's and a button. The purpose of this app
         is to add the values in the two editText's and show the result in the textView when the user clicks on the
         button.
         
    2) Create an app that contains two activities. The first activity must contain an editText and a
       button, the second only a textView. The purpose of this app is when the user clicks the button,
       display the second activity showing the message he wrote in the first.
       
    3) Creating an app contains two activities. The first activity must contain three editTex's and the second
       a textView. The purpose of this application is to display in the three editTex's the values captured from the
       device accelerometer. When there is a significant acceleration in any of the axes, show the
       second activity displaying a message of your choice.
       
    4) Create an app that displays light sensor information.
    
    5) Choose one more type of sensor and show the information regarding it in it
       screen from the previous exercise. Examples of other sensors: gyroscope, magnetometer,
       temperature, pressure.
